-----------------------------------------
Intended architecture:
- angular/node
- scss styling convention
- css3/canvas or svg ui elements and animations
- two domains and server types:
 -- viewdit.com - management of posts, pages, users, navigation, etc
 ---> This is the first phase of the project, to be built as a posting medium for embedded links to existing video sites, with voting and message boards, content "channels" or "stations", individual playlists ("my stations") and more
 -- viewd.it - management of video uploading, compression, encoding, media library and site reference
 ---> This is phase two - a native video hosting platform build in a scalable hosting environment configured for video and streaming

Notes:
- Project Started - UX/UI designs to be uploaded for initial concepts to folder "./concept/uxui/"
- As a standard convention, please stick to this format when updating README (create a header tag with the date, time and handle of the editor)
- Please use this readme as an redundant and ongoing record of version updates committed to Master
